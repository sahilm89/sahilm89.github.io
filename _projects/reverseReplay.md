It has been recognized that neural activity in the hippocampus is often organized as reliable sequences. These appear as place-cell sequences, time-cell sequences, and sequences concerning other continous variables (Aronov et al, 2017). Curiously, the same sequences have also been seen to occur during rest period between tasks, and sleep (Louie and Wilson, 2001). Even more surprisingly, they also occur in the reverse order and/or compressed in time (Diba and Buzaki, 2007). We are currently looking at the mechanism behind this curious sequence reversal behavior in sharp-wave ripples.

I am a **postdoctoral researcher** at the <a href="https://zhanglab.oeb.harvard.edu"> Zhang Lab </a> at Harvard University, where I investigate how learning reorganizes **brain-wide neural dynamics**. My research focuses on **modeling and analyzing whole-brain neural activity** data from *C. elegans* to understand how distributed neural populations evolve during learning and encode adaptive behavior. I am interested in how memory is instantiated and coordinated across the entire nervous system by combining **theory-guided experiment design**, **computational modeling** and **machine learning**.

A unifying theme of my work is understanding how **memory and learning** emerge from neural circuitsâ€”across scales, substrates, and levels of biological organization.
 
During my PhD at the [National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru](http://ncbs.res.in),  I explored the foundations of memory at microcircuit and molecular levels.

At the **neuronal level**, we demonstrated using the rodent hippocampus as a model system that a _precise EI balance_ exists in the brain, where random presynaptic inputs are balanced at timescales shorter than the membrane time-constant ($$\lt \tau_m$$). We showed that this precise EI balance enables a <a href="/projects/EI_balance/">subthreshold gain control computation </a>, which allows for a flexible encoding of a wide range of subthreshold inputs and a transformation of input amplitude information into spike times.

At the **molecular level**, I exhaustively modeled all possible (~3500) _small_ <a href="/projects/chemical_bistables/">_bistable_ chemical reaction networks</a> capable of storing 1 bit of memory- biochemical flip-flops that may operate at synaptic scales. Our simulations mapped the landscape of motifs that remain robust to perturbations like thermal noise, reaction-rate variability and structural changes, identifying families of reliable molecular architectures for memory storage at femtoliter-scale synaptic compartments.

Currently, I am building <a href="/projects/cedne/"> CeDNe</a>, a Python-based platform that integrates multi-modal data- anatomical, molecular, and neural activity datasets into cohesive, data-driven models of the nervous system.

I am a computational neuroscientist, currently working for the Human Brain Project at KTH, Stockholm. I am interested in understanding how neural syntax is structured and transformed between different hierarchical levels in the brain. During my PhD at the [National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru](http://ncbs.res.in), I worked on the neuronal and molecular levels. 

At the neuronal level, we showed that a _precise EI balance_ exists in the brain, where random presynaptic inputs are balanced at fast ($$\lt \tau_m$$) timescales. Moreover, precise EI balance in a feedforward EI network naturally leads to a <a href="/projects/EI_balance/">subthreshold gain control computation </a>. 

At the molecular level, I looked at all possible small <a href="/projects/chemical_bistables/">_bistable_ chemical reaction networks</a>. These can work as biological flip-flops and store 1 bit of chemical memory at chemical synapses. Here we showed that certain patterns of chemical networks can be very robust to memory erasure due to different kinds of perturbations.
